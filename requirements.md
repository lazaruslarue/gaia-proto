It was great talking with you today about the Gaia opportunity.

Enclosed is the design comp for a page from our new webapp.
Use the tools you are comfortable with and focus on a single video tile.

Based upon our conversation, I'm assuming Angular/Webpack.

The API below will give you an array of json objects so you can use that to display multiple video tiles on a page.

You can do this either client or server side, your choice. Things we'd like to see are project structure, promises, using the API, componentized structure, basic (really basic) page layout, testing, documentation, and styling. On the last part, we use a BEM syntax and Sass/Suzy but use what you are familiar with.


Here is the public endpoint: http://www.gaia.com/api/videos/term/119931
If the cache isn't warm, it might take a few seconds.
Set the headers to Accept application/json.
Send me your github or bitbucket repo on Monday am.
